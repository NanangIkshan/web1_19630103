            <p>There was a time when I was alone
                No where to go and no place to call home
                My only friend was the man in the moon
                And even sometimes he would go away too
                Then one night, as I closed my eyes
                I saw a shadow flying high
                He came to me with the sweetest smile
                Told me he wanted to talk for a while
                He said Peter Pan that's what they call me
                I promise that you'll never be lonely
                And ever since that day
                I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
                Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
                And when we're bored we play in the Woods
                Always on the run from Captain Hook
                Run run Lost Boy, they say to me
                Away from all of reality
                Neverland is home to lost boys like me
                And lost boys like me are free
                Neverland is home to lost boys like me
                And lost boys like me are free
                He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
                Believe in him and believe in me
                Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
                To your beautiful destiny
                As we soared above the town that never loved me
                I realized I finally had a family
                Soon enough we reached Neverland
                Peacefully my feet hit the sand and ever since that day...
                I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
                Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
                And when we're bored we play in the Woods
                Always on the run from Captain Hook
                Run run Lost Boy, they say to me
                Away from all of reality
                Neverland is home to lost boys like me
                And Lost Boys like me are free
                Neverland is home to lost boys like me
                And Lost Boys like me are free
                Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy darlin
                Even Captain Hook you are my perfect story book
                Neverland I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
                Forever a lost boy at last
